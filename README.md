# Path Finding implemented using Q-Learning

## Description

This project is a continuation to two of my previous projects [Raycasting Engine](https://github.com/farreeez/raycasting-project) and [TicTacToeAi](https://github.com/farreeez/TicTacToeAi) where I used the raycasting engine to further solidify my understanding of reinforcement learning concepts. This time I implemented path finding through the use of tabular Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a table to store the values of state-action pairs. Through this approach, the AI learns the optimal path by updating the values based on rewards received from different actions, allowing it to make more informed decisions. Additionally, I made minor enhancements to the Raycasting Engine, including the addition of automatic shooting.

here is a video demonstrating how the program works.

### Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* Java Swing

Make sure you have the JDK installed and properly configured on your system, as well as the Java Swing library, which is typically included with the JDK.

### Executing program

* Simply run the Main.java file and enjoy :).
* For controls, use W A S D to move around and the left and right arrows to look around, or click m to toggle looking around using the mouse. You can also shoot the stick figures or the doors by clicking the left mouse button.
